The master branch contains starter code. See solution branch for working version.

### Get Started

For local development

1. Fork and clone
2. Run `npm i` (run `npm audit fix` if needed - stuff changes a lot in React!)
3. Create a `.env.local` file at the top level 
4. Create an environment variable called REACT_APP_SERVER_URL set to the localhost server's url
